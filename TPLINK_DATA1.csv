B008IFXQFU,Midhun Pankaj,5,INR 499 well spent !,Reviewed in India on 17 November 2018,"It's almost 2019, and I still have no idea why most desktops don't come with builtin WiFi chips. But since that ain't the case, and quality matters, TP Link was definitely the way to go, and so I did. Works like a charm, and was just plug and play on my Windows 10 PC. Blazingly fast, and is working fine on my 100mbps fibre internet connection. If you don't have WiFi on your PC, don't even have second thoughts. Just go for it.",1
B008IFXQFU,Divya Kothari,4,"Great Design, Build, Connectivity Range, Packaging and other features but no linux support since v2",Reviewed in India on 11 November 2018,"(Pictures attached)Size/Design:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Build Quality: ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Packaging:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Software:  ★ ★ ★ ★Speed:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Connectivity:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Experience:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Warranty:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Size and Design:The best part about this is that it is very compact in size and very sober and elegant in design. This is a big plus as it is easy plug in and use, add to it the good sober design.Build Quality:The build quality is undoubtedly superb. Just no qualms about that, at all. When held, it doesnt give off that cheap and flimsy product-like feeling. It is good sturdy with its build quality.Packaging:This part is also a big plus as the item was well cushioned and packaged with all the necessary items that ensured that no damage could have been caused to the product during transportation. This ensures that I as a customer have received something not damaged internally already.Software:This is actually good but not great part with the product.The good part is that a CD has been provided with it along with a manual.The not great part is that NO LINUX SUPPORT has been given from Version 2 onwards. This is bad, really.Speed:It easily supports net speeds upto 300 Mbps. Practically speaking, I have tested it at my home and it easily supports net speed of over 100-150 Mbps without a sigh.On testing I found that it did connect to 5GHz network, without any issue.Connectivity:Please mark its not feet its metres. Multiply metres x 3 to get the distance in feet.It easily connects to my laptop or phone from 7 metres across one room. So thats 21 feet. I mean even our old bluetooth used to connect to about 15 ft.So 20-25 feet is not at all an issue with this. This is the big plus I found with the product.Experience:From this point of view, so far except the linux non-compatibility issue, I found no other flaws with this product.So overall its a great product.Warranty:Its 3 years so I am assured that atleast for 3 years I am tension-free and not just 1 year, contrary to most electronic items today that only provide 1 year warranty with their items.",1
B008IFXQFU,Himanshu Mishra ,3,not compatible with kali,Reviewed in India on 20 December 2017,"even though its a new version of TL-WN722N it is not compatible with kali also it doesn't have atheros ar9271 chipsetreturning as its not compatible but if you are getting this only for windows and mac , you are good works perfect with windows",2
B008IFXQFU,Joshua Prince,1,Useless for Linux people.,Reviewed in India on 2 October 2017,It didnt work with kali linux.

B008IFXQFU,Malcolm,1,Dont waste you're money,Reviewed in India on 18 December 2018,This product is really horrible..dont even waste your money...my pc is 2 meters away from the wifi router yet i dont get full range...  The most frustrating part is it has major driver issues..the driver cd they provided by them is way worse than the drivers available on Windows 10..it messes with the already included windows 10 drivers and ruins stability if you even try to use another wifi usb adapter..  Worse part is it loses net connection every 2 minutes and you have to switch on airplane mode and off it to reset the connection...and after all this i couldn't return it because it was only replaceable not refundable..BUY AT YOU'RE OWN RISK!!!,0
B008IFXQFU,Amazon Customer,5,Bought for Honda City Digipad and it works!!,Reviewed in India on 16 March 2019,Works with Honda City 2017 Digipad infotainment system. Just plug into the USB port and thr digipad will automatically start searching for nearby wifi networks.,1
B008IFXQFU,ichen,1,Range is too low,Reviewed in India on 27 September 2018,"I bought this to connect my office desktop to the WiFi network. Unfortunately, it can catch the signal only when others are not using such as early morning before my colleagues come or late night. My laptop can perfectly catch the signal at the same position but not this WiFi receiver. It can recieve from my Mobile hotspot. But whats the point? Some reviewers said it is better than the laptop WiFi. It is NOT the case with me. Uselessly lying since the pass three months after having tried in many ways. NOT recomended.",0
B008IFXQFU,Buyer's Remorse,2,WARNING --- AWFUL Driver support from TP-Link,Reviewed in India on 15 August 2019,"Bought this back in 2018 expecting better driver support from TP-Link compared to Netgear. I was wrong.=====-PROS=====- It works. You can just plug it in and Windows 10 will install a driver for it,  you won't even have to install the one from their site. Isn't that amazing folks?=====-CONS=====- NO, no it isn't amazing. First of all, everyone (who knows how to use a PC) knows that Windows 10 installs obsolete or broken drivers for any hardware. So for this TP-Link, it installs some ancient driver that doesn't have the ""Wireless Adapter Properties > Advanced > Wi-Fi Config > Performance/WiFi"" section. Which means, the adapter runs at low signal quality no matter how far your Router is. So the only way to get maximum signal is to install official drivers from TP-Link site. Which brings me to..- BROKEN DRIVERS on Windows 10. Seriously, they were last updated in 2018 and Windows 10 keeps breaking them especially on every Windows update (like W10 does for some old hardware). You'd think that a company like TP-Link would fix this issue, but then you'd be wrong.So basically, now I have to repair the drivers every few restarts or whenever Microsoft decides to break them again. This is fun... like ""face-planting on a gravel road"" fun.",0
B008IFXQFU,ravisankar,4,GOOD PRODUCT,Reviewed in India on 20 September 2018,THE WIFI ADAPTER IS GOOD ONE. IT WORTH VALUE OF MONEY AND WORK PERFECTLY. IT AUTOMATICALLY CONNECT TO WIFI WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM AND ALSO USE TO SHARE FILES FROM U R MOBILE USING SHARE IT OR XENDER . THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT IT PACKAGING ONE SIDE OF THAT PRODUCT COVER IS DAMAGE IN TRANSIT. OTHERWISE IT DO NOT HAVE ANY PROBLEMS SO FAR. DAMAGE SIDE PIC I ADD WITH MY REVIEW,1

B008IFXQFU,SahilGoel,5,Not for Kali Linux users,Reviewed in India on 18 March 2018,As of 2017 the V1 has been discontinued and only the V2 is being shipped. If you are looking for an adapter for Kali Linux then this wont work but if you are looking for a replacement in windows 10 then this is the best so far. It shows you routers from like a kilometer away which you didn't even know existed.,1

Still surprised  to see tp-link Wireless N USB Adapter is not able to detect tp-link wifi.Then i ordered tp-link extender thinking that the distance is more then 40 feet.TP-Link wireless adapter is not still working as expected.Since this exercise took more then 3 month , now i can't return my TP-Link wireless adapter",0
B008IFXQFU,Ram,5,Excellent! TP-Link does it again!,Reviewed in India on 17 May 2019,"Short version: Need a network speedup for that older laptop or desktop with no wired connection available? Get this and be happy.It's not often that a particular brand turns out to be good every single time, but TP-Link is one that does. Bridge, WAP, NIC, Gigabit switch, and now this USB wifi adapter. I'm 5 for 5 being very happy with a TP-Link purchase. This 802.11n adapter did exactly what I hoped it would. I have an older laptop with built in 802.11g. I use it with a treadmill desk, and for some reason, even though ""g"" is faster than my ISP, with that old laptop, I only get about half the speed I do with wired Ethernet. So I too a chance. It worked. Now speedtest.net reports the same Internet speeds on my wireless laptop as my wired desktop. Youtube treadmill videos stream better than ever and don't hiccup when a large email is downloading at the same time.The only way installation could have been easier would have been if Amazon had someone open the package for me. I plugged it it, selected my local wifi connection, typed the wireless key, and we're ready to rock 'n roll. A mini-CD came with the adapter, but I didn't need it with Windows 10. The adapter comes with a cap, in case you need to remove and store it. Activity light confirms it's moving data.",1
B008IFXQFU,Pavan,4,Channel Incompatibility.,Reviewed in India on 23 May 2020,"I wanted to use this product for my desktop. But it wasn't recognising my Mobile hotspot. After digging a bit in the TP-Link User community, I found out this adapter is made for the US region that supports channels from 1 to 11 @2.4 Ghz. My mobile hotspot uses channel 13 and i couldn't change it in the settings as i am running stock android.There is a same adapter made for European market that supports channel 1 to 13. But this EU adapter isn't available in India as per my conversation with Amazon Customer Service.Hence I'm returning this.",1
B008IFXQFU,Shannon Kotian,4,Best WiFi USB adapter!,Reviewed in India on 1 January 2019,"Best WiFi USB adapter for desktop/laptop. Just plug the device to USB port of your PC and install the drivers from the CD provided. The adapter will start searching nearby WiFi signals automatically when it finishes installing necessary drivers. I am using this adapter in my desktop and connected to the rear USB port of the motherboard for high stability. There is no signal drop issues till now and upload speed and download speed is very good. There is a green color LED light which shows the status of the adapter. Due to nano design, the internal antenna is very small to catch weak WiFi signals. I don't prefer this if you are planning to buy this WiFi adapter if there is larger distance between your WiFi router and WiFi adapter.It will not be able to detect the WiFi network or there might be frequent disconnection issues.For smaller distance this WiFi adapter will work fine.",1
B008IFXQFU,Gam3rNash,5,Quality for the price,Reviewed in India on 18 February 2017,"Works well. Good design. Compact. No issues till now. The indicator led is a good feature and not annoyingly bright even in the dark. Integrates into the os well, can use the taskbar buttons to turn on and off. Its not necessary to install the wifi utility program.  Cd worked correctly and installed drivers without any issues.  Overall very satisfied with the product.",1
B008IFXQFU,Pritam Assrani,1,(Maybe) A good product but didn't work for me.,Reviewed in India on 31 January 2019,Although this product had a good rating with many satisfied customers and more than many 4 5 star reviews I was not satisfied with my purchase. This wireless adaptor refused to connect to my Wi-Fi SD card in my camera. I bought this to replace my 10 year old D-Link USB Wi-Fi adaptor. It's connected easily to my Wi-Fi network. But I just could not connected to my Wi-Fi SD card in the camera. I ended up buying an edimax Nano Wi-Fi adaptor which worked seamlessly and was a five star product for me.,0
B008IFXQFU,vive un legado,1,It is not plug-n-play... you need to install drivers for any version of windows (including 10),Reviewed in India on 17 July 2020,"On windows 10 it initially found working straightaway without installing device drivers.We specifically purchased it for this plug-n-play support (since all chinease devices are known to have firmware and driver vulnerabilities).But soon we found the device intermittently not working, even pings were timing out.Later found, windows 10 was not using correct driver (used Realtek one).Then we removed that driver for this device, and found Windows 10 could not identify the device manufacturer or device id properly.Downloaded the software online. And installed it. THen device working okay. (But this was not expected).Next found the range is very minimal and lots of retransmits keep happening.felt N300 feature may not be working fine on this device.Never used as a hotspot. Recommend not to use that way... do not trust the device driver installed!!Will throw away once a better one available in market for our Desktop PC.",0
B008IFXQFU,Prasenjit Das,3,Issue is not 100% resolved,Reviewed in India on 27 August 2020,Recently my 6 year old laptop developed connectivity issues with modem. I thought the inbuilt adapter must be damaged hence I purchased this product. Currently I see the laptop connects to wifi with inbuilt adapter sometimes. There are occassions when it does not connect but after plugging this device it gets connected. However there are days when everything fails and I need to restart the modem or use datacard.I gave 3* as my issue is not completely solved however the product might be fine. My issue could be laptop h/w related.,2

It supports windows 10 , Mac OS , and also Kali which is great. And I also try it on android and it does support for it also.Good Strength.Easy to use.If your laptop doesn't have CD Slot then you can easily download the driver from the tp-link website.Also, It supports packet injection , and also monitor mode and works like charm.And this is V3.2 not V1, V2.So V3.2 supports kali, packet injection, monitor mode.",1

B008IFXQFU,Jaison Thomas Joy,4,Good for Laptops With Less WiFi Signal,Reviewed in India on 24 July 2019,I have been using this for the past 3 years and it is still in good working condition.

B008IFXQFU,Sahaj Sarup,1,"Not Exactly ""Compatible"" with Linux",Reviewed in India on 4 February 2019,"The up-streamed firmware with kernel 4.20 doesn't work.

B008IFXQFU,Jeevan Chaukar,5,Initial Review - Working fine......Long term review will take more time...,Reviewed in India on 13 July 2020,"The product came with an installer CD/DVD.  Just did the installation and plugged in the product on my Windows 10 desktop. It started working fine immediately. I am mainly using my Wifi enabled printer from this desktop as it is anyway connected with the internet using direct LAN cable.Unfortunately the product is MADE IN CHINA and that's something I didn't like. However, despite many attempts, I failed to find any MADE IN INDIA substitute for this and hence went with this relatively well established name.Locally, there are quite a few other products available at a lower rate.Overall, these days Amazon is becoming costlier and one should always check in nearby shops before finalizing any purchases on Amazon. Chances are that you will save a significant % of money by buying locally.Forget the older era of Amazon where it gave major discounts compared to offline shops. Now it is the exact opposite.Amazon competitor Flipkart is nothing different - that is also costlier for many items than local shops.",1
B008IFXQFU,Amit Dabholkar,5,VERY MUCH SATISFIED WITH THE PRODUCT.,Reviewed in India on 21 January 2020,"I got my BroadBand for which I needed a wireless wifi usb receiver. After a lot of survey I decided to buy TP-LINK 150 Mbps Wireless N Nano USB Adapter. Just within two days the product was delivered via ekart. The packing was nice and rigid. When I opened the packing I found my TP-LINK 150 Mbps Wireless N Nano USB Adapter in a sealed pack.After installing the software and plugging in the adapter it was an airy breeze flowing all over.. the connectivity is awsome. Network signal is even better than some of the other products of the same price range.my neighbor uses a netgear product. we tried to compare with my signal strength with it and to my surprise i found my nano was delivering even higher network signal strength than the NetGear product without any drop.As electronic product may give different feeling to different to different people, I convey my opinion for this one as WORTH BUYING..........",1

B008IFXQFU,Jude Soosai,1,A slow device. No good range. No TP-Link driver for windows 10,Reviewed in India on 14 December 2018,"I bought this for my Win10 laptop with slow built-in wifi. Surprised to find that this version of h/w (v1) does not have a driver for Windows 10 in TP-link support page. However windows 10 seem to have detected it (may be some built-in TP-Link driver in Win10?). ( Note: In the wifi settings menu, the built-in one has to be disabled and the usb wifi has to be enabled). But the speed was way too low than the built-in wifi. Disappointed.I tried this device on Win 7 also. The downloaded driver failed to install. However managed to install it from the device management menu. Again the speed was much lower than the built-in wifi. Wondering who would need this device.",0
B008IFXQFU,Shrinivas Morje,3,"Good buy, but cannot say better",Reviewed in India on 1 August 2020,"After reading few of the reviews, I bought this device but I received BE. Further searched on YouTube I was able to find video about how to install for V3 of this device for Kali and death attacks  or packet injection sniffing, if you are beginner and learner like me, and you don't want to go for high cost as learner like me, you can definitely go for this product, but if you are expert or professional, definitely you will look for better options like Alfa adapters, the only issue I faced with this product is range of this product, it's not as expected and that reason packet sniffing is not that strong or intensive sometimes, but as I said, if you are learning, it's definitely a good option to buy. You can do all activities like death, handshake etc to learn the concepts. Just want to add, this can sniff both 2.4 and 4 ghz frequencies. Sio, I rated this 3 stars.",2

B008IFXQFU,Sayak Bhowal,5,Tiny workhorse and simply awesome.,Reviewed in India on 30 May 2020,I got it almost in a price of a very cheap wifi router. My expectations were not so high. But I am really surprised with its wifi signal connection strength and almost zero speed loss or signal strength loss. It's very easy to use. Just plug it in and press the ONLY button to get it started for the first tym. From the next tym don't worry your pc will do the rest .... forget that you have an external USB wifi device.5stars....It's recommended from my side. Cheers.,1
B008IFXQFU,Vignesh,3,Does few more thing than 150 Rupees Wifi Dongle-Its a Indepth Tecnical Review,Reviewed in India on 5 February 2020,"See the pictures!!!, I'm not Complaining about the dongle, almost every dongle is like this,My Wi-Fi router sits right next to my PC dongle and my router is within One Meter range, This dongle is rate for 150 Mbps but Look at the results My network is over 250 Mbps on wire, But the dongle gives 50 Mbps. I bought this for b/g/n option only so I don't care about this , My old 150 rupees dongle is n type only it can receive WI-FI but cant put hotspot that is the reason I purchase this dongle ,for connecting my mobile with my pc, this Dongle does that job well no issue,You may think My router 2.4 Ghz is weak ?? But trust me  I did do speed test with my mobile(Samsung Note 9) , it shows 90Mbps,What im saying is Wired net is Lighting fast than Wifi.If you are purchasing this dongle for Connecting your PC or Laptop ,Don't expect your Internets Full speed !!! I Don't recommend any WIFI dongle. Use wire That will be the wise choice",2
B008IFXQFU,GRC Murty,5,good product. Buy it if your laptop or pc does not have an in-built Wi-Fi card.,Reviewed in India on 24 July 2020,"I've been using it for almost a month on my Windows 10 computer, my computer does not have an in-built Wi-Fi card.Detailed review:1. Delivery- I got the package before expected delivery date and the amazon agent followed proper social distancing protocol.2. packaging- The packing was good and the box which contained the Wi-Fi adapter was sealed and the Wi-Fi adapter was well placed. the box contained the Wi-Fi adapter, quick installation guide and a CD to install the driver.3. Driver installation- I inserted the CD and downloaded and installed the driver in less than 2 minutes with the help of a YouTube video. in case you faced any problem with downloading and installation of the driver ( which I did not), the amazon page of this Wi-Fi adapter itself has a video that has detailed steps on how to troubleshoot any problem and install the driver in case the CD does not work.4. Wi-Fi adapter- I've been using it off and on since a month and it works perfectly. being a nano Wi-Fi adapter it still picks up the Wi-Fi bandwidth from the Wi-Fi modem in the other room but the Wi-Fi bandwidth decreases a bit. However, the internet works perfectly.5. Conclusion- Overall, this Wi-Fi adapter is a very good product. if your computer or laptop does not have an in-built Wi-Fi card then you can buy this product for rs.500. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who needs to connect Wi-Fi to their laptops or computers that don't have an in-built Wi-Fi card.:)",1
B008IFXQFU,Tanmoy B.,4,A must buy,Reviewed in India on 24 September 2018,"Got this thing on a sale. Never bought a TP link before. But still went for this one. And I am surprised with the performance. It comes with a CD (still don't know why in this age?), which you will never use. Using this for a year. I plugged it on my backside of PC and set up windows. To my surprise it got detected and connected to my WIFI even during windows installation. So no need for extra drivers. Just 'plug n play'.There has been no drops just occasional once or twice in a week (bearable). Although I must say the range is a bit low, around 10ft (direct) and 5ft (through wall).I am using jio4G mobile hotspot with this and I get speed of around 20Mbps with this. No problem in connectivity. Go for it.",1
B008IFXQFU,Z5000,5,Bye Bye Low Signal Strength,Reviewed in India on 13 May 2020,"Just got this on the 13th of May, 2020. My desktop was too far away from my house Wi-Fi and both Wi-Fi card and dongle dropped the signal frequently. When they did connect, the speed was only about 20%. So I ordered this TP-Link TL-WN822N N300 Wireless High Gain USB Adapter (White) to solve this issue. All I can say now is: problem solved. In fact I'm writing this review on the very desktop to which the device has now been installed.Pros:1. Reasonable pricing (I bought this for 899 Rupees)2. Easy Installation on Windows 10: Plug and play3. Speed seems to be at about 80-90% as per my internet connection plan4. Long wire enables variety of placements for best signal strength location5. Compact and light. I was surprised it's so light.6. Stable and consistent connection.7. Driver CD provided in case you are using older operating systemsCons:Nothing really negative comes to mind on first usage. So far so good.Conclusion:If you have similar low signal strength due to long distance from the Wi-Fi router, then this is certainly an option to consider. Cheaper alternatives are available but since I've used small donlges, they are not suitable if your desktop/laptop is not in the same room as your Wi-Fi router. I was looking at the more expensive alternatives as well, but decided to go for this one as it has two antennae and costs below 1000 Rupees.",1

I purchased this product and the result was dramatic! I am getting a full wifi- at least way better than what i used to get. The company is very thoughtful and has given a extension usb adaptor without which you will definitely use two USB adaptor space if you plug this in- it's very big to sit into one single USB space. Just check if you are going to get the USB adaptor cable or at least you have multi-port usb adaptor at home.I use it in windows 10- it was just plug and play.,1

Drivers are already there in windows 10 so no need to install anything. Simply plug and play. Signal and speed is ok. Max 60 mbps speed achieved.

B008IFXQFU,SANJAY PATEL,2,Not so Good Product,Reviewed in India on 18 July 2020,"This USB LAN CARD(device) description says about everything except how long distance this device can work or cover range for ? No where it is mentioned that it will cover 2 meter or 3 meter or 5 meter range and just says it is sleek and wireless which is the catch here. If you are looking this device for more than 2 meter distance then its better to go for LAN cable with CAT6 or more version. If you buy this device thinking it would look sleek and wireless then believe me its total waste of money even though the device is working. Moreover, there is no option of returning this device and is just replaceable. What's the point of replacing the device if the device is working but of no use. It will be just lying in your drawer. So to sum-up, if u are looking for 1.5 to 2 meter range or more Wi-Fi connectivity then better go for LAN Cable with CAT6 or higher version which will cost lower or similar to this device.",0

Its 150mbps so you can't expect a high speed internet for hd or full hd streaming. Its for surfing and watching max 480p videos. Works fine with Windows 8.1. Haven't tried it on windows 10. It's usb 2.0.  You have to first install driver through disk provided in pack.Pros- Has Good Range for receiving signals.- Affordable and Branded.( Don't buy cheap stuffs if you are looking for long run).- Isn't visible.

I hardly use it for 3 hrs continuously.But overall you can buy it if you want it for normal errands and want something branded and durable below Rs 500.",1

There are other brands providing the product at very low, attractive price, but I would recommend not to compromise with quality and reliability for a few bucks.

Performance is far better than in-built Wi fi receivers coming with laptops - because laptop brands always compromise with quality of ""in-built"" items due to cost and competition.+1 for ease.

I had to remove and reconnect the dongle to fix the issue. I at times blamed my usb port or the ambient temperature which might be overheating the dongle though on touch I never felt it getting any hotter than usual.What fixed it for me - For win10 - Go to Control panel -> hardware and sound -> device and printer -> properties of tp link adapter -> hardware -> properties ->  general -> change settings  -> advanced options -> follow the change given in the attached image.Hope it works for you.

My requirement was to have internet connectivity in my PC DESKTOP WITHOUT a wired connection from Router to CPU.After reading all positive and negative reviews on Amazon and various sites, took the decision to buy it and it was a good decision.In terms of ""ease of use"", it's just plug n Play, no additional configuration to be done. I just removed the wired connection and plugged it to CPUs USB port. Then from Network icon in System Tray, searched for available Wi-Fi connection (this means System was able to auto configure successfully) and got connected (ofcourse after putting the WiFi password).

The USB also disconnects for no reason with the slightest physical disturbance, faulty port is my guess. Internet goes 999 ping every 4-5 secs for a while and reconnects back which is why gaming with this is literally hell. Tried updating the firmware, brought closer to router and while even on high priority the glitches occur. Do yourself a favor and skip this. Have been using a variety of TP Link products for all networking. They're mediocre to abysmal, barely meeting your internet quota.",0

B008IFXQFU,Biplab Nath,3,Does not seem to work well with mobile hotspots,Reviewed in India on 6 September 2020,"Product : TL-WN821NReview : Used it for my PC with Windows 7. After installation, it was able to detect and connect all the strong wifi signals available, including my phone's hotspot. After 2 days of usage, it was able to detect and connect to other available wifi signals, but it stopped detecting my phone's hotspot. At first i assumed it to be a driver issue, so i uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers, but the issue was not solved. I used the product on my laptop, and it had the same issue. Then i checked my phone's hotspot, which turned out to be working fine as other devices were able to connect to it. I have tried almost all the major troubleshooting fixes found online, but none of them seem to work. I think it is a compatibility issue which can be easily resolved by TP-link by a software update (the last one being on 2018 for Windows). I am returning the device for now.",2

B008IFXQFU,Sudeerkrishna,5,A wise choice for desktop computer,Reviewed in India on 21 December 2018,"This review is about TL-WN822N.My desktop is about 10 meters away from the 300N router and I was using dlink DWA-123 N150 usb thumb style wifi adapter. Even though the dlink adapter showed connection speeds upto 90-120Mbps, the internet performance was very poor, I was getting only 2-3Mbps(I have 40Mbps VDSL connection).I was contemplating buying a internal PCI adapter for desktop but eventually chose this as internal adapter antenna would face a wall as the cabinet is lying under the table. Installation was simple, installed the drivers from the CD provided.Performance seems to be remarkable, this adapter sees as many as 17 networks in the vicinity against just 3 seen by DWA-123. Link speeds are at full 300Mbps most of the time and  at 144Mbps few of the times. I am getting full internet throughput now at 40Mbps.Overall a good buy, hope this thing lasts.",1

Tp link is one clever company, they have mixed the reviews of all their products. Disappointed over all, soft ap mode is worst part, the device driver (latest version) is really buggy and frequently crashes in windows 10, had to reinstall it every couple of days to enable soft ap mode, and about the monitor mode in kali, i have tried it without installing the drivers and it does not work out of the box.Better to avoid this device and purchase a repeater for few more bucks.
